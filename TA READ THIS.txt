I tried to leave comments on the submission but there was an error doing so, so here is a resubmit.
I also am adding some changes I just made, the original submission was on time and good,
so if we would lose points for the late submission, just grade that one.
However, these improvements are cool, so I thought you would want to see them.
Contributions:
Leif did fractal visual generation, and made zooming in work
Miguel did movement and made the sprite, which is not currently used due to debugging.
